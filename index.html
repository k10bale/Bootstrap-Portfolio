        <p>Hey there, welcome to my portfolio. There isn't much on here now, but hopefully in the next 6 months there will be a lot more going on here. 
        </p>
        <p>For now, I'd like to tell you a little about myself. I am a 28 year old female, currently residing in Richmond, VA. I'd like to think of myself as "Queen of the East Coast" because I have lived in almost every "region" along it. To start off, I was born in one of the most Southern parts of the East coast- Miami, Fl. When I was about 8 years old I started my trek up the coast by moving to Richmond. Here I went to middle school and high school and absolutlely loved every minute of it! 
           After high school, I attended the University of New Haven in Connecicut. Not to get into too much detail, the university was subpar (at best) and I am just not a fan of New England. In 2012, I transferred a bit further south to Seton Hall University in Northern New Jersey. Jersey gets a bad rap, but I can assure  
           you its nothing like the show "Jersey Shore." It's deemed the "garden state" for a reason, its very green and lush in the summertime, and is packed with reservations and hiking trails. The beaches aren't like my native florida ones, but thats okay! I graduated SHU with a bachelors degree in Visual Media and Broadcast.
            I moved back down to RVA a couple years after graduating because I missed how chill and easy of a place it is to live. Jersey is wonderful and I still visit often, but I was over the constant hustle and bustle in the NYC area. 
            I did nothing with my degree, and have been working as a professional dog sitter/ walker for the last few years. </p>
        </p>
        <p>I love dogs more than I like people. I'm so passionate about them, that sometimes I wish they didn't exist at all, because I can't save them all. On a more positive note- I also love the beach, hiking, traveling, swimming, food, beer, and starting to love CODING;) </p>
